Structure the summary with the following segments:

### **Document Type:**
Clearly state what kind of document this is:
- e.g., Employment contract, Legal claim form, Offer Letter of Employment, Notice of Resignation, etc.

---

### **Personal Identifiers:**
List all identifiable personal information found in the document, clearly segmented:
- **Full Name:** [e.g., John Doe]
- **Address:** [e.g., 123 Main St, City, Country]
- **Email:** [if available]
- **Phone/Mobile:** [if available]
- **Other Identifiers:** (e.g., passport numbers, claim numbers, national ID, dates of birth, etc.)

---

### **Contractual or Financial Information:**
Identify and itemize any financial amounts or contract-related details, specifying currencies and their purposes:
- [XXX AED/USD/etc.] - for [salary, end of service, settlement, reimbursement, etc.]
- [XXX AED/USD/etc.] - for [damages, penalties, etc.]
- Interest Rate %

---
### **Claim Value Breakdown:** (if exists)  
If the document contains a claim for financial compensation or reimbursement, this section should itemize and clearly present each contributing element that forms the total claimed amount. Use a structured format that allows quick verification and legal clarity.

For each line item, include the following:

- **Component:** What the amount is for (e.g., unpaid salary, end-of-service, vacation days, bonuses).
- **Rate/Unit:** If applicable, mention the per-month or per-day rate used.
- **Duration/Quantity:** Specify the number of months, days, or units.
- **Amount (Currency):** Show the computed value of the component.


Display the full breakdown in bullet list, for example:

- **Unpaid Salary**: 33,000 AED  
- **End-of-Service Gratuity**: 11,000 AED × 3 month = 33,000 AED  
- **Total Claim Value**: **66,000 AED**

**Note:** This section is critical for validating whether the total claim value is correctly derived from its components. Ensure consistency in currency, math logic, and legal relevance.
---

### **Purpose and Legal Context:**
Briefly describe:
- The document's function or intent (e.g., initiating legal action, establishing terms, evidencing a claim),
- Its role in the broader case or legal process.

---

### **Legal Domain:**
Specify the area(s) of law relevant to this document:
- e.g., Employment Law, Contract Law, Civil Procedure, Personal Injury, etc.

---

The summary should be **formal**, **fact-focused**, and **suitable for case file indexing or legal review**, helping legal teams quickly assess the document’s relevance and content.
